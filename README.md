AI Object Tracker

This project demonstrates **real-time object detection and tracking** using **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** and **PyTorch**.  
It processes video streams, detects objects, and visualizes motion trajectories.

Features
- Object detection via YOLOv8
- Real-time object tracking
- Frame-by-frame visualization (OpenCV)
- Modular code for experimentation

Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLOv8

Usage
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```

## 🎥 Demo
A simple demo video is included in `data/input_video.mp4`.
